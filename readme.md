## Running Express + PostgreSQL on CoderPad

This pad is running a NodeJS Express application, with a built-in connection to a PostgreSQL database.  We've also installed Sequelize, which is a promise-based ORM tool to make it easy to interact with the database.  Changes are automatically applied as you type them, and you can add as many files to the project as you need.

To get started, edit the `src/server.ts` file, and query your API to see the response.

### Accessing your API

We've installed `curl` in the container running your application, so you can make requests to your API directly from the Shell.  For instance, you can run `curl 127.0.0.1:3000/test` to see your server's output.

### TypeScript

The app is pre-configured to support TypeScript, but you can define .js files instead if you prefer.  Compilation and type checks are handled by [SWC](https://swc.rs/), a Rust-based platform for compilation and bundling that greatly decreases compilation time.

### IntelliSense

IntelliSense is running across your entire project, allowing you to see when there are syntax errors or to get quick hints for how to resolve errors or TypeScript issues.

### Shell

A shell is provided to you so you can inspect your container in more detail.  The shell can be used to install NPM packages using `npm install <package>`.  In addition to installing packages, the shell can be used for executing a test suite if you have one defined.

**Note: while it's possible to edit files directly from the shell, we recommend using the editor to make your changes.  That way, other people in the Pad can see your changes as they're being made.**

### Container Limits

The container running your application has a few limitations.  Currently, we don't limit your CPU usage, though this may change in future.  In addition to CPU, we monitor the network bandwidth that is consumed, and limit you to 75mb for the duration of the container.  Finally, we limit the amount of memory accessible to each container to 0.5 GB.
